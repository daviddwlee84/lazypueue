# Staged Go CLI distribution

Read when making a Go CLI installable by other users. Match the distribution
work to the requested release: source installation can be enough for an early
version; a Homebrew formula is not a prerequisite for sharing a useful tool.

## First stage: source installation

Inspect `go.mod`, the executable's `package main`, the license, and supported
platforms. Publish an install command for the actual main-package import path.
A layout with `cmd/forgebox/main.go` needs `/cmd/forgebox`, not just the module
root. For example, dev-cli's package is:

```sh
go install github.com/daviddwlee84/dev-cli/cmd/dev@latest
```

Document the project's minimum Go version, supported OSes, fixed-version and
upgrade commands, and executable location. Go installs into `GOBIN` when set,
otherwise normally `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`; users must include that
directory in `PATH`. Explain how to inspect `go env GOBIN GOPATH` instead of
assuming every installation uses `~/go/bin`. Add shell completion instructions
if the application provides it.

`@latest` is a version query: it prefers releases, then prereleases, then the
default branch tip when no versions are available. It does not generally mean
the newest commit on main. Show a pinned published semver tag for reproducible
installs, and distinguish branch/commit installs as development builds.

A local build does not validate public installation. Once publication is
authorized, push the reviewed source and final semver tag, then install the
fixed tag and `@latest` from outside the checkout with a disposable `GOBIN`.
Check `--version`, help, and a safe offline command on those installed binaries.
Verify the repository/tag are publicly reachable before claiming the public
commands work. Versioned `go install` ignores the surrounding module; also
check that the released module has no unsupported local `replace` dependence.
Publish a new tag for a correction rather than moving a published version.

## Version reporting across build paths

A release workflow may inject a string using `-ldflags -X`, while ordinary
`go install ...@version` does not run that workflow. Resolve versions in this
order:

1. A meaningful explicitly injected release/build value.
2. `runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo().Main.Version` when present and not `(devel)`.
3. A truthful development fallback such as `dev`.

Treat empty/default sentinel values as unset, preserve meaningful pseudo-versions
for commit installs, and keep plain version output independent of the network.
Test injected precedence, module-version recovery, and the development fallback.
A test binary often has no release module version: use a small pure resolver
for deterministic tests and verify an actual installed release afterward.
Update checks and self-update behavior are separate product features.

When an explicit upgrade command is requested, read
[self-update.md](self-update.md). Choose its strategy from the artifacts actually
published and ownership of the running executable. Build provenance alone does
not identify an installer, and a moved Go-built binary needs an update at its
current resolved path. The reference covers source-only releases, verified
assets, package managers, local-build preservation, and transactional replacement.

## Changelog and release consistency

Maintain a user-facing `CHANGELOG.md` with an Unreleased section and dated
version sections. Record visible behavior, compatibility changes and fixes;
do not replace it with internal commit chronology. When backfilling an existing
release, inspect what its tag actually contained. Link upgrade instructions to
the changelog and choose the next version under the project's policy.

Finish tests and required CI on the exact source to release. Then create the
immutable tag and derive release notes from that version's changelog section.
The changelog version, Git tag, hosted release and installed `--version` must
agree. Source `go install` needs the tag and module metadata, not merely a changed
hard-coded constant or a local build with injected linker flags. Verify fixed-tag
and `@latest` installs outside the checkout; account for public proxy indexing
before treating a newly pushed tag's absence as a code failure.

## Later stage: packaged releases

When users need installation without a Go toolchain, add the requested OS/arch
archives, checksums, release CI, and install/upgrade/uninstall verification.
Choose the package manager for the supported audience: for example, a personal
Homebrew tap can follow macOS/Linux release assets. Do not couple an early
source release to upstream Homebrew acceptance, Windows packaging, or automatic
updates unless they are part of the task.

Keep source installs and packaged releases on the same public version contract.
If an operational skill is embedded, it travels with each binary; end users need
no separate `npx skills` update for `--skill` output. A separately installed skill
copy needs an explicit refresh path if that feature is offered. Updating the
project's development skills remains a contributor workflow.
For a requested distribution pipeline, the optional
[CLI release skill](https://github.com/daviddwlee84/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/local/cli-release-distribution)
covers broader release-channel work.
